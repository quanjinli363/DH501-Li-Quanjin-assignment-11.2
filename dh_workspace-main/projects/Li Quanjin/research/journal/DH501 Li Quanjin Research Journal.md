Have finished the textbook research and overseas school data.
As I intend to utilise contemporary history textbooks as my primary research material, but there are extensive content within these texts,so my initial step was to collate sections related to Sino-Japanese relations. And then, I undertook data cleansing—much like our previous group assignment—to remove some dirty data like 之 乎 者 也 from the dataset. So there is a cleaned file. Subsequently, there was a slight adjustment to my approach. Initially, I intended to conduct topic model analysis on these materials. However, having recently encountered the concept of p-values last week, I felt this method would be more effective. Consequently, this week's work involved performing p-value analysis on the content. I then constructed a table using "China" and "Japan" as window words to identify the most frequently associated terms for each. The results thus far are satisfactory and appear to support the arguments I intend to present.
