## Background and Context (the W's)

Following the outbreak of the 918 Incident(Mukden Incident), domestic public opinion became embroiled in a debate between advocates for war and those for peace. A lot of Chinese people were searching for a direction for the nation's future, and overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia were no exception. There are numerous contemporary records indicate that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, Southeast Asian overseas Chinese provided multifaceted support to their homeland--including financial resources, weapons, and some skilled personnel. This demonstrates their deep ties to their motherland and their attitude in favor of resisting Japanese aggression. Given that Southeast Asia was home to the largest overseas Chinese community and maintained the closest connections with the motherland after Japan's armed invasion of Northeast China in 1931, did their educational policies shift due to the domestic situation? What was their stance? How did they express their concern for the motherland through education? What specific changes occurred in educational policies? All these questions makes me so curious about this history so I want to select this topic to research.

## Research Puzzles
For the research itself, it is necessary to explore the changes in Southeast Overseas Chinese education following the 918 Incident and analyze the issue from multiple perspectives. This approach can clarify how Southeast Asia Overseas Chinese responded to their homeland under the unique circumstances after the outbreak of the 918 Incident. How the educational system for overseas Chinese in the Southeast Asia was impacted by the shifting domestic landscape, and what role these influences played in both the domestic resistance against Japanese aggression and the development of overseas Chinese schools in the Southeast Asia.

As for me, first,it is important to know how to use concise and logical language to argue the pre-established viewpoint through interpretation of the excerpted content. Second, the volume of primary sources concerning the education of Southeast Overseas Chinese after the 918 Incident is enormous, thus requiring strong literature retrieval skills. It is also necessary to categorize and summarize historical materials according to the writing outline, selecting only those relevant to the theme for inclusion. Finally, throughout the research process, learn to utilize currently acquired technical skills as auxiliary tools to enhance the efficiency of literature review.

## Methodology

VS code,python,zetero

## Data and Sources

The data and materials primarily originate from the series Compilation of Research Materials on Modern Overseas Chinese History, edited by Huang Xiantang and published by Shanghai Science and Technology Literature Press. The focus is on identifying content related to overseas Chinese education in Southeast Asia, including minutes from Southeast Asian overseas Chinese education conferences, newsletters from Southeast Asian overseas Chinese schools, and relevant textbooks used in Southeast Asian overseas Chinese schools.


## Expected Outputs
## The structure of the research
I. Overview of Overseas Chinese Education Development in the Nanyang Region Before the 918 Incident(Mukden Incident)

II. The Nationalist Government and Overseas Chinese Education in Nanyang After the 918 Incident(Mukden Incident)

III. Changes in Overseas Chinese Education in Nanyang After the Incident

IV. Impact of the Domestic Situation After the 918 Incident(Mukden Incident) on Overseas Chinese Education in Southeast Asia


## Working hypotheses

Although Southeast Asian overseas Chinese communities reside in foreign lands, they have consistently followed the footsteps of China. Changes in domestic politics, economy, culture, and other areas have significant influence on the education of Southeast Asian overseas Chinese. Following the 918 Incident(Mukden Incident), Southeast Asian overseas Chinese schools make some changes in curriculum design and teaching content, incorporating new elements that examined Sino-Japanese relations and revisited the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, future research should use identifying materials that substantiate this perspective.

## Challenges and Risks

In the course of my research, I require primary source materials concerning the education of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. These materials include meeting record related to education, school newspapers from overseas Chinese schools, and textbooks used by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia during the Republic of China period. It is important to note that the Republican era marked a transitional period between classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese. Consequently, these materials contain numerous classical particles such as "之" "乎", and "者" The presence of these particles could slow down the reading speed of primary sources during research. Therefore, I plan to first clean these documents using VSCode and Python, retaining only meaningful words and phrases.
Additionally, because of the extensive content and broad scope of the textbooks,if I use the original method to sift through them would be extremely time-consuming. Therefore, I plan to use a Python program and LDA model to group the articles using topic modeling. This approach will focus on keywords like "Sino-Japanese relations" and "war" facilitating efficient text filtering.

## Action Items

1. Store the retrieved literature in Zotero for categorization.
2. Add details to the structure at any time
